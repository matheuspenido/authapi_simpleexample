# Simple API with Authentication
A very simple example of a Authentication and Authorization with JWT Bearer and .NET API

Here we have a simple way to create a token using the loginController, and at same time we are able to use the generated token to get authentication and authorization using the HomeController.

There are no good practice here, no DI, controller returning strings instead of ActionResult, static classes, fake database and so on...
